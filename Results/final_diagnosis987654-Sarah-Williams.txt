### Final Diagnosis:

**Possible Health Issues:**

* **Cardiovascular Disease:** The patient's elevated blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and family history of heart disease increase her risk for cardiovascular complications.
* **Anxiety Disorder:** The patient's occasional lightheadedness, palpitations, and shortness of breath may indicate underlying anxiety.
* **Sleep Apnea:** The patient's occasional palpitations, particularly when lying down at night, suggest potential sleep apnea, which can contribute to fatigue and lightheadedness.
