### Final Diagnosis:

- **Stable angina:** The patient's symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea are consistent with stable angina, which is caused by a temporary reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle. This can be due to narrowing of the coronary arteries, often caused by atherosclerosis.
- **Anxiety:** The patient's intermittent chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea may be indicative of anxiety attacks. These symptoms can be triggered by stress, physical exertion, or other factors.
- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):** The patient's symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea can also be caused by GERD, which is a condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus.
